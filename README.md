# B-W_To_Color
The main file of the black and white to rgb convertor is the B&WtoColor.py file .
Before running the main file , download the prototxt , caffemodel and the pts_in_hull.npy files and place them in the same folder as the main file.
Also download and put the jpeg images in the same folder as the rest becuase those are the sample input images.
After downloading all the files, open the code of the main file and put the path of the  prototxt , caffemodel , pts_in_hull.npy and the Input image files
at the designated locations in the main file.
After this the code will run smoothly with no errors.
Thank You.
